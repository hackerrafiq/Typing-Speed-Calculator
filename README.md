This is a simple Typing Speed Calculator built in Python. It allows users to test their typing speed and accuracy by comparing their input against randomly selected sentences.

📋 Features
Measures typing speed in words per second.

Calculates typing accuracy by counting errors.

Includes random test sentences.

Loops until the user exits.

🛠️ Requirements
Python 3.x

No external libraries required.

🧪 How It Works
Run the Python script:

bash
Copy
Edit
python type.py
Type yes to begin a test.

A sentence will be shown. Type it as accurately and quickly as possible.

The program displays:

Your speed in words per second.

Number of errors compared to the original sentence.

Type no to exit the program.

🧩 Code Breakdown
mistake(partest, usertest)
Compares the original sentence (partest) and the user's input (usertest) to count character-wise errors.

speed_time(time_s, time_e, userinput)
Calculates the time taken and derives typing speed based on number of characters typed.

🚀 Sample Output
bash
Copy
Edit
ready to test: yes/no :yes

Modern education blends technology and traditional learning, fostering skill development and critical thinking in students.

Enter: Modern education blends technology and traditional
Speed :  2 w/sec
Error :  73
📚 Future Improvements
Add WPM (Words Per Minute) instead of characters/second.

Include a GUI using Tkinter or PyQt.

Highlight mistakes in real-time.

Save results to a file or leaderboard.
